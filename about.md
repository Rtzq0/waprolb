The Long Beach __Web & App dev Professionals (WAPRO)__ group [meets monthly](http://meetup.com/lbtech) to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and the values of open source software (F/OSS).  We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for _all people_ in our community.

This site is hosted from our [github repository](https://github.com/lbtech/lbtech.github.io).  We use it because we like _all things internet_ ... plus its an easy way for us to collaborate and learn together.  Want to join us?  Find out the next time we plan to [meetup or gather](http://meetup.com/lbtech).  Or, [Fork one of our repos](https://github.com/lbtech), and submit a pull request.

##  Call for Presentations

We want you to come share your awesome project with us.  If you are local to Long Beach, or will be in the area, and would like to present on a topic, please contact me.  We are interested in learning about everything cool that makes us think or makes us better at Web Development, (Web & Mobile) Application development, or Mobile development -- or ideally where these technologies converge.


## Call for Sponsors

We _totally_ get hungry and thirsty at these things.  Sometimes we even need a venue for a meetup.  If you're looking to **earn some Karma by picking-up a tab or providing space** for our meetup, _then you're totally our type of friend!_  As a group we'll  _Thank You_ and give you recognition. Maybe that means a company logo or message on a slide, or possibly we'll let you address the group?  But thats about it.  We're here to geek out not listen to some lame sales-pitch.  Sorry, we just felt it should be clear that we're looking for a fairly easy, No-Strings-Attached NSA type of thang.  _wink wink, nudge nudge._  Ok, the last part was meant to be funny, but the point is: Sponsors are awesome, we want 'em! But it should mostly be about your Karma and us getting free grub, not you buying an audience or pillaging our talent.  On the other hand, there's a possibilty it'll lead to us getting to know you more or (dare say it) **"liking you."**  But no promises, okay?
