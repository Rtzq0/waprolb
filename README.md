### Current Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uncodedlb/waprolb.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/uncodedlb/waprolb)

## About
The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Github hosts static HTML and Jekyll based websites for free.  Github uses a default naming scheme for repositories, and as a result our site can be viewed at  [http://waprolb.github.io/](http://uncodedlb.github.io/waprolb/) -- but it is setup for its own domain: **waprolb.org.**  Github allows us to utilize our custom domain by adding a [CNAME file and configuring our DNS](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider/).  Therefore our website is best accessed at:  [http://www.waprolb.org](http://www.waprolb.org/)
