### ABOUT
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Below are some potential topics for future meetups, or at least conversation starters when we get together:

**PRESENTATION**
[ANSIBLE](http://www.ansible.com/):  EASIER, FASTER, AND MORE RELIABLE THAN PUPPET OR CHEF

DEVOPs master and all-around Drupal ninja, Ashok Modi, will be sharing about how he uses Ansible for easy safe deployments and maintenance of servers.

> Currently a Computer Systems Analyst for the [Cherry Hill Company](http://chillco.com/). My primary duties involve working on the web presence of Libraries, EDUs, and other non-profits and intimately working with various technologies to bring their goals to fruition. Outside Cherry Hill, I dedicate some of my time in working on a freelance basis and, whenever possible, contributing back what I learn and/or create back to the open source community. Right now (and for the past 8 years), that community happens to be Drupal whereby you can find out a lot more about projects where I have contributed back at http://drupal.org/user/60422.


**PRESENTATION**

**PRESENTATION**
ON BEING A PYTHONISTA AND DJANGONAUT

Python has never quite been the hot language du jour, but it has a large and loyal following both on and of the web. It’s equally at home as a systems scripting tool, advanced maths environment, and Web application language. The language syntax and design philosophy favors simplicity and idiomatic style. As briefly as possible I’ll take you on a tour of the Python ecosystem, particularly as it relates to Web application development.
