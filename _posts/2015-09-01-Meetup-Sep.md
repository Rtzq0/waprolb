### ABOUT WAPRO  
The Long Beach Web & App Professionals (WAPRO) group meets monthly to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imagination, builds our skill-set, expands our network, and grows community!  

The Pros that have worked on/for projects such as Spacex, Riot Games, X-prize, Adobe, Toyota Motor Sports, VMWare, UCLA, CSULB, AARP, and more ... have shared amazing talks this year on tech and projects such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io), [Browserfy](http://browserify.org/), [Headless Drupal](https://github.com/davidhwang/horseman), [iOS Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Node.js](http://iojs.org), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io), [Zapier](http://zapier.com) and more.

Every month we come together to:

* Demo technologies we use, especially those driving the convergence of websites and mobile apps
* Showcase our projects built with cool tech
* Share industry "best practices"
* Newcomer Q&A's
* Network, get to know each other, and otherwise have fun


We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Let us know what you'd like to see at an upcoming meetup by tweeting using the hash #WAPRO.  

If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us! Our meetups are FREE and open to [EVERYONE](https://github.com/uncodedlb/uncoded-policies).

### DETAILS  


**SHOWCASE**  
A NEW CREATIVE MARKETPLACE BUILT WITH A COLLECTIBLE YOU CAN'T TOUCH  

What is a collectible and how has it changed in the era of cryptocurrency? A demo and discussion on how an intangible digital product can change the music industry and more. In addition to the demo, we'd like to spark a discussion on if/how users will build a relationship (like your favorite record/painting/G.I. Joe Collectable) but with a 'file' thats value/worth is based on the access it provides OR a psychological attachment. Presented by Assignment Creative.
