### ABOUT  
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Below are some potential topics for future meetups, or at least conversation starters when we get together:
