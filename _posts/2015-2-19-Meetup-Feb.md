title: Feb 19, 2015 Meetup (TBD) - Web & Application Professionals Meetup
---

> Note: This is a work in progress.  If you're interested to speak, sponsor, or otherwise help, please [contact Mike](/about).

The Long Beach __Web & App dev Professionals (WAPRO)__ group meets monthly to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and the values of open source software (F/OSS).  We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for _all people_ in our community.

### TALKS THIS MONTH

* Aaron Pederson - Let's talk about SASS
* TBD


>  MAIN PRESENTATION
>  Let's talk about SASS ||  Presentation by [Aaron Pedersen](http://twitter.com/aaronpedersen)
>
> The "coding" concepts behind [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) leave many front-end developer resistant to the language and process. In this talk, Aaron will cover the basic concepts and show you how easy it is to get up and running with SASS and how to integrate it into your development workflow. As an example, we'll be checking out the [lbtech.github.io](https://github.com/lbtech/lbtech.github.io) repository, making some modifications and pushing those changes to github. The goal of this talk is to show you how the language can help speed up development and bring more organization and beauty (yes code can be pretty) to your css code base.

### ABOUT
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Below are some potential topics for future meetups, or at least conversation starters when we get together:
