**Presentation**  
ON BEING A PYTHONISTA AND DJANGONAUT  

Python has never quite been the hot language du jour, but it has a large and loyal following both on and of the web. It’s equally at home as a systems scripting tool, advanced maths environment, and Web application language. The language syntax and design philosophy favors simplicity and idiomatic style. As briefly as possible I’ll take you on a tour of the Python ecosystem, particularly as it relates to Web application development.
