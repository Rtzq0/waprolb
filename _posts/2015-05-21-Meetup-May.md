Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imagination, builds our skill-set, expands our network, and grows community!  If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!

We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.
