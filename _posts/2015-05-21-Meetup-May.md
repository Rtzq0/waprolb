### ABOUT  
[Long Beach Web & Application Professionals #WAPRO](http://wapro.lbtech.org)  
Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imagination, builds our skill-set, expands our network, and grows community!  If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!

We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Visit our website for more information and learn how to get invovled!  [http://wapro.lbtech.org](http://wapro.lbtech.org)

**Presentation**  
ON BEING A PYTHONISTA AND DJANGONAUT  

Python has never quite been the hot language du jour, but it has a large and loyal following both on and of the web. It’s equally at home as a systems scripting tool, advanced maths environment, and Web application language. The language syntax and design philosophy favors simplicity and idiomatic style. As briefly as possible I’ll take you on a tour of the Python ecosystem, particularly as it relates to Web application development.
